This is a small kivy application.  I haven't even built it, it may not build.
Feel free to start anew.

To use kivy (python) for this normally, a bug would ideally be fixed in audiostream.
https://github.com/kivy/audiostream/issues/25

Alternatively, according to that issue, a more verbose solution using pyjnius would work.
The people on the thread may be able to help.
